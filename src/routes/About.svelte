	<h3>ABOUT</h3>
	<p>
		I like to code.<br />
		I'm currently getting better at it in
		<a href="https://www.hive.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hive Helsinki.</a>
		<br />
		There, we build libraries, tools, and apps from scratch mostly in C/C++. We also develop many skills
		making us adaptive, cooperative, and dependable.<br />
		Outside of Hive, I follow my interests in machine learning and graphics.<br />
